I am an academic with a special interest in **Quality Education**. I have a background in Computer Science with a specialization in data and analytics. My teaching/research are focused on data and analytics for quality education. Thus I touch data, analytics, visualization, MOOCs, HCI, and AR/VR through my research.

I use qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods to holistically investigate education. Thus my current work focuses on observing the current education measures. In the future, I want to use that understanding towards enhancing and creating quality education frameworks. For this goal, I worked as a lecturer and gained academic teaching experience over two years. Then joined corporate teaching and currently works as a technical trainer for a [British company](https://www.codification.io/). I hope in the future there will be an opportunity for me to combine all my experience into one, spice it up with my data and analytics background and create great education measures.

I received my M.Sc in Big data analytics from [Robert Gordon University](https://www.rgu.ac.uk/) and B.Sc-1st in Software Engineering from the [University of Plymouth](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/). My interest in better education was initiated during my undergraduate studies because I came from an inferior educational background. Thus I contributed to many voluntary activities plus focussed all my research on quality education. As a result, I was selected for [Gold Student Ambassadorship](https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com/en-US/studentambassadors/profile/72ac770b-8fd2-4436-91bd-590e3df929a5) from Microsoft in 2021 and later awarded [Microsoft WI MVP](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/mvps) award in 2023. 

I like interdisciplinary work. My special interest in education allows me to be a disciplinary nomad. Education has no limits. Sometimes I use data and analytics to improve Echonomic education and on some other occasions, I read about augmented reality for early childhood education. However, I spend a lot of my time in the fields of Data and Analytics which allows me to use qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods. I often use more statistical forms of analysis to contextualize and further support more qualitative approaches, frequently collaborating with people from other disciplines. I frequently speak at conferences and events, and I also consult with various groups, organizations, and companies about a wide range of topics.
