        <span style="background-color: #92c9f1">Hi! My name is Indrajith,</span>
        and I am an academic with a special interest in Quality Education. I
        have a background in Computer Science with a specialization in data and
        analytics. My teaching/research are focused on data and analytics for
        quality education. Thus I touch
        <span style="background-color: #92c9f1">data</span>,
        <span style="background-color: #92c9f1">analytics</span>,
        <span style="background-color: #92c9f1">visualization</span>,
        <span style="background-color: #92c9f1">MOOCs</span>,
        <span style="background-color: #92c9f1">HCI</span>, and
        <span style="background-color: #92c9f1">AR/VR</span> through my
        research.<br />
        <span class="read-more-target"
          ><br />I use qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods to
          holistically investigate education. Thus my current work focuses on
          observing the current education measures. In the future, I want to use
          that understanding towards enhancing and creating quality education
          frameworks. For this goal, I worked as a lecturer and gained academic
          teaching experience over two years. Then joined corporate teaching and
          currently works as a technical trainer for a
          <a href="https://www.codification.io/">British company</a>. I hope in
          the future there will be an opportunity for me to combine all my
          experience into one, spice it up with my data and analytics background
          and create great education measures.<br /><br />I received my M.Sc in
          Big data analytics from
          <a href="https://www.rgu.ac.uk/">Robert Gordon University</a>. and
          B.Sc-1st in Software Engineering from the
          <a href="https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/">University of Plymouth</a>. My
          interest in better education was initiated during my undergraduate
          studies because I came from an inferior educational background. Thus I
          contributed to many voluntary activities plus focussed all my research
          on quality education. As a result, I was selected for
          <a
            href="https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com/en-US/studentambassadors/profile/72ac770b-8fd2-4436-91bd-590e3df929a5"
            >Gold Student Ambassadorship
          </a>
          from Microsoft in 2021 and later awarded
          <a href="https://insider.windows.com/en-us/mvps">Microsoft WI MVP</a>
          award in 2023. <br />
          <br />
          I like interdisciplinary work. My special interest in education allows
          me to be a disciplinary nomad. Education has no limits. Sometimes I
          use data and analytics to improve Echonomic education and on some
          other occasions, I read about augmented reality for early childhood
          education. However, I spend a lot of my time in the fields of Data and
          Analytics which allows me to use qualitative, quantitative, and
          computational methods. I often use more statistical forms of analysis
          to contextualize and further support more qualitative approaches,
          frequently collaborating with people from other disciplines. I
          frequently speak at conferences and events, and I also consult with
          various groups, organizations, and companies about a wide range of
          topics.
